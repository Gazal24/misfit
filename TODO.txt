* write specs (datamodel is nearly complete, no reason not to have tests already)
* runner creating the loan history
* extend user system with simple goup based permissions
* finish the views for users and staff members
* write a payment generating factory (yaml fixtures are fine for the other resources) for testing, development and demos
* StaffMember to Staff ??
* some sort of an action logger like audit trail, preferably user centered (presenting nice overview of all action), easily accomplished with hooks
