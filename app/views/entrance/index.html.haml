  %h2 Development process
  %p MIS FIT is in very late beta and about to reach its first release.
  
  
  
  %p
    We believe passionately in
    = link_to 'open source', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source'
    therefor we prefer to use Linux over Microsoft's Windows (or Apple's OSX). Yet the following tools are worth mentioning because the helped making MIS FIT possible.
  
  
  %table.form

      %td{ :style => 'text-align: right;' }

        We love the Ruby programming language. It has revolutionized the way programmers can do their work, and, maybe more important: it helps us to write better software, using less lines-of-code, in less time!

        = link_to 'The Ruby programming language', 'http://ruby-lang.org'

        == #{link_to 'Merb', 'http://merbivore.org'} is a fantastic web development environment that "just makes sense". It borrows a lot of concepts form #{link_to 'Ruby On Rails', 'http://rubyonrails.org'}, and it has been announced that it will be merged into Rails as of version 3. Together with Merb we use several other tools that are worth mentioning:
        %ul
          %li== #{link_to 'DataMapper', 'http://datamapper.org'} &ndash; a god-sent ORM,
          %li== #{link_to 'haml', 'http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com'} &ndash; to ease the pain that is HTML and CSS,
          %li== #{link_to 'Open Flash Chart 2', 'http://teethgrinder.co.uk/open-flash-chart-2'} &ndash; for all our graphing,
          %li== #{link_to 'mod_passenger', 'http://www.modrails.com'} mod_passenger for apache &ndash; as otherwise we'd still be in the stone age.
  

  %h2 Download, use, test-drive, feedback, etc.
  
  %p As mentioned we currently do not recommend MIS FIT to be used in a production environment. Yet in anticipation of MIS FIT becoming "the best for free" you might want to check it out non the less. It is recommended to have some experience with Linux servers (do Apache, MySQL, bash and ssh ring a bell?). If you cannot get it to work that is no problem, as we are gearing up to deliver MIS FIT as a "managed service". This way we take care of installing and maintaining your MIS FIT installation for you.
  %p== Stay tuned for more updated and in the mean time #{link_to 'enjoy the source code', 'http://github.com/svs/misfit'}.
  %p If you just want to test MIS FIT you do not have to download it: the site that you are looking at right now is a live demo of MIS FIT!
  %p== #{link_to 'Proceed to the login page', demo_uri}, and use login 'admin', and password 'password' to start testing MIS FIT. In case the demo is not working properly, please let us know.
